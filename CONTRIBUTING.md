# Contributing to vLLM Optimizer

## Reproducible software validation

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12. This command runs the complete software gate in fresh
isolated environments: source tests, coverage, lint, types, docs, audit,
package checks, and clean-wheel tests. A global package cannot affect it:

```powershell
.\scripts\validate-software.ps1
```

Python 3.12 is the designated deterministic coverage-gate version. CI runs
behavioral and clean-wheel tests on both Python 3.11 and 3.12.

Maintainers also run the external sibling `vTune-private-tests` suite. Hardware
validation is a separate deferred release gate.

vLLM Optimizer favors small, explicit components over framework-heavy abstractions.
Read [the architecture](docs/project/ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing execution flow.

All contributions go through a pull request. Direct pushes and force pushes to
`main` are blocked for contributors; the repository owner reviews and merges
accepted changes after the required package and documentation checks pass.

## Development setup

Configuration/report development also works on Windows; POSIX process tests
require Linux or WSL. Install documentation dependencies before the docs check.

Requirements are Python 3.11 or 3.12 and—only for real benchmark runs—a Linux or WSL host with an
NVIDIA GPU and working `vllm` and `guidellm` commands.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[test]" -r requirements-docs.txt
vllm-opt --help
```

The repository contains deterministic behavioral tests that use no models,
secrets, GPU data, or private fixtures. Run them before opening a pull request:

```bash
python -m pytest -q tests
```

Maintainers may keep additional regression tests outside the checkout when
they require private fixtures or hardware. Tests do not replace source review.

## Where changes belong

- `config/`: YAML loading and runtime policy validation.
- `domain/`: tool-independent immutable records and statuses.
- `workers/`: one focused external operation per worker.
- `managers/`: orchestration policy, scoring, and persistence.
- `search/`: search-space expansion and sampler sessions.
- `benchmarks/`: backend command construction, timing, and parsing.
- `reporting/`: CSV, analysis, charts, tables, and static HTML composition.
- `reproduction/`: manifests, redaction, metadata, display, and export.
- `lifecycle/`: completed-run integrity and manual retry planning.

## Adding a component

For a worker, implement `execute(context)` and `cleanup(context)` from
`workers/base.py`. Return structured `WorkerResult` values; never terminate the
run or an unrelated process from a worker.

For a search strategy, implement `SearchSession` from `search/strategy.py` and
add validation/construction in `search/factory.py`. A strategy must preserve
deterministic IDs and never execute a resolved configuration twice.

For a benchmark backend, keep backend-specific CLI serialization and parsing
outside the domain model. Launch commands as argument arrays through
`ProcessRunner`; never use shell interpolation.

For reporting, consume persisted/domain results. Reporting must not launch
servers or benchmarks and must label exploratory statistics honestly.

## Project rules

- State the plan and obtain approval before editing.
- Keep responsibilities narrow and follow SOLID pragmatically.
- Files normally stay at or below 150 lines and never exceed 200 lines unless
  generated or vendored.
- Preserve immutable completed runs and owned-process cleanup.
- Keep documentation synchronized with user-visible behavior.
- Commit only deterministic tests and fixtures that contain no credentials,
  model files, GPU data, private artifacts, or secrets. Keep sensitive
  regression tests outside the checkout.

## Before submitting

1. Review every changed line and dependency.
2. Run the relevant private tests and broader regressions when shared behavior
   changed.
3. Build and install the wheel in a fresh environment.
4. Run a real GPU smoke test for lifecycle or benchmark changes.
5. Confirm no `vllm-opt`-owned process remains and no private artifact is tracked.
6. Update README, MVP specification, architecture, or roadmap when behavior or
   an extension point changed.
