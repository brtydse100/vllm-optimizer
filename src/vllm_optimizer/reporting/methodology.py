<dt>Output tokens/s</dt><dd>Generated output tokens divided by measurement time. Total tokens/s includes prompt and output tokens.</dd>
<dt>TTFT</dt><dd>Time from sending a request until its first generated token.</dd>
<dt>TPOT</dt><dd>Average time per generated output token after the first token.</dd>
<dt>ITL</dt><dd>Delay between consecutive streamed output tokens.</dd>
<dt>E2E latency</dt><dd>Time from request start until the complete response is received.</dd>
<dt>Average / median / P99</dt><dd>Arithmetic mean, 50th percentile, and 99th percentile. P99 means 99% of observations were at or below that value.</dd>
<dt>Elapsed</dt><dd>vLLM Optimizer wall-clock time from benchmark subprocess launch through JSON result parsing; vLLM server startup is measured separately.</dd>
</dl>
<p class='note'>The benchmark backend calculates request distributions and percentiles. vLLM Optimizer maps backend names and units into one schema without deriving missing percentiles. Report comparisons use repeat means. For scoring, eligible workloads are averaged within a benchmark execution, repeated executions use their {aggregation} score, and named benchmark scores are averaged into the trial score.</p></section>"""
