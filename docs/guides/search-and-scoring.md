# Search and scoring

Request failures are an eligibility gate controlled by
`benchmark.max_failure_percentage`. Among eligible trials, the configured
`optimization.maximize` metric is the primary objective in search, persisted
rankings, baseline comparison, terminal output, CSV, and HTML. Ties use failure
percentage, failure count, and trial identifier in that order.

Choose `grid` for exhaustive small spaces, `random` for a bounded sample, or
`tpe` for guided exploration. Random and TPE searches do not execute the same
resolved configuration twice.

```yaml
optimization:
  maximize: output_tokens_per_second
  sampler: tpe
  trials: 20
  seed: 42
```

`maximize` names the metric used to rank trials. Direction is inferred: the
declared metric is always maximized. For each named benchmark, the `vllm-opt` CLI averages
the eligible workload metric values, takes the median when it was repeated,
then averages named benchmark scores into the trial score. A workload with an
errored or incomplete percentage above `benchmark.max_failure_percentage` is
excluded; the setting defaults to `0`. A trial without an eligible workload is
not ranked.

Grid evaluates every unique configuration and is best for small spaces. TPE
uses completed trial results to choose promising configurations, so it is the
better default for larger spaces where exhaustive Grid search is impractical.

The fixed `server` configuration runs first as the baseline. The report
shows the best observed configuration and its difference from that baseline.

TPE state is persisted in the run's SQLite study. Runs themselves remain
immutable: a retry creates a new linked run instead of rewriting history.
